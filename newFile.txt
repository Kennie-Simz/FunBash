This is a send to file example and we use the "cat" command to write to a text file directly from terminal in bash.
It is interesting you can actually type even more paragraphs, not just one.

When you want to get out of this you can simply press ctrl D on the keyboard.However, if you want to append more text to this file after writing out of it, you would need to update the cat command with a double greater sign, i.e. '>>' so as not to overwrite whats already in this document.
Happy learning!
